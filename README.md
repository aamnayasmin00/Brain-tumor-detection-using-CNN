# Brain-tumor-detection-using-CNN
This project is about detecting brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model classifies images into tumor and no-tumor categories with good accuracy.

Dataset
Dataset taken from Kaggle (Brain MRI dataset)

Contains images of brain with tumor and without tumor

Stored in a ZIP file â€” needs to be extracted before running the code

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

OpenCV

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing

Load and resize images

Normalize pixel values

Split into training and testing sets

Model Building

CNN architecture using Keras

Activation: ReLU

Output Layer: Sigmoid

Model Training

Adam optimizer

Binary cross-entropy loss

Track accuracy and loss

Evaluation

Accuracy score

Loss curves

Confusion matrix

Prediction

Test the model with new MRI images

Output prediction as tumor / no-tumor

How to Run
Extract the dataset ZIP file.

Update the dataset path in the notebook.

Run all cells in brain tumor detection.ipyng.ipynb.

Check the output accuracy and prediction results.
